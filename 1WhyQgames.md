# Motivation and a short history on quantum game developement

## Why Quantum games
It is our privilege to explore the rather new quantum computational space with Noisy-Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices in this generation. Albeit 


Looking back into the history especially in the 1970’s, arcade game developers already started the machine-level programming and prepared themselves as the future coders even if the hardware was still limited. In the meanwhile, game-driven breakthrough for the classical hardware, such as the first 3D acceleration chip Super FX in Nintendo super-NES home console, also demonstrated the possibilities where new hardware could be inspired by the game developers.

In this article set, we hope to contribute to quantum education by leveraging the experience of classical arcades in the 70’s. We would like to introduce you the QArcade, a coding friendly platform for quantum game developers. By building and open-sourcing documents for QArcade, we hope to assist educators with limited programming backround and to inspire the next generation quantum workforce.
